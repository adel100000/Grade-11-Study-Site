      "content": "Exponential functions are functions where the variable appears as an exponent. The general form is $f(x) = a \\cdot b^x$, where $a \\neq 0$ and $b > 0$. Here, $a$ represents the initial value or starting point of the function, often the y-intercept. The base $b$ determines the rate of growth or decay: if $b > 1$, the function represents exponential growth, and if $0 < b < 1$, it represents exponential decay. Real-world examples include population growth, bacterial reproduction, and radioactive decay.",

      "content": "When graphing exponential functions, there are several important points to remember. The horizontal asymptote of the graph is $y = 0$, which means the graph approaches this line but never actually touches it. The vertical stretch or compression of the graph is controlled by the coefficient $a$. For growth functions ($b > 1$), the graph rises rapidly as $x$ increases, and for decay functions ($0 < b < 1$), the graph decreases rapidly.\n\nExample: $f(x) = 2 \\cdot 3^x$ starts at $y = 2$ when $x = 0$ and grows rapidly because the base $3 > 1$.",
