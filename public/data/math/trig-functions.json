      "content": "Trigonometric functions are periodic, meaning their values repeat at regular intervals called periods. For the main trig functions:\n- $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$ have a period of $360°$ (or $2\\pi$ radians).\n- $\\tan(x)$ has a period of $180°$ (or $\\pi$ radians).\nThe key property is that $f(x + \\text{period}) = f(x)$ for any $x$. This allows us to analyze just one full cycle, as the rest repeats identically.",

      "content": "Understanding periods is crucial because it helps predict values without calculating for every $x$. This is essential for graphing, modeling waves, and solving trig equations. Visually, you can shift or repeat a single cycle along the x-axis to understand the behavior of the function over any interval.",
