      "content": "A sequence is an ordered list of numbers that follows a specific pattern. There are two common types of sequences:\n- Arithmetic sequence: each term differs from the previous term by a constant difference $d$. \n  - Formula: $$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$\n  - Example: 2, 5, 8, 11 → here $d = 3$\n- Geometric sequence: each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio $r$.\n  - Formula: $$a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$$\n  - Example: 3, 6, 12, 24 → here $r = 2$.\nUnderstanding the type of sequence helps us predict future terms and solve problems efficiently.",
