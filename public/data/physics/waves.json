      "content": "A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy through space or a medium without carrying matter along permanently. For sound, the medium is usually air (but it can also be water, steel, etc.).\n\nKey quantities:\n- Wavelength (λ): the distance between repeating points on a wave (for sound: compression to compression), measured in meters (m).\n- Frequency (f): the number of cycles per second, measured in hertz (Hz). Humans typically hear about 20 Hz–20 kHz.\n- Period (T): the time for one cycle, in seconds (s). It relates to frequency by $$T = \\frac{1}{f}.$$ \n- Amplitude: the maximum displacement from equilibrium; for sound, larger amplitude corresponds to louder sounds.\n- Wave speed (v): how fast the disturbance travels. For any periodic wave, $$v = f\\,\\lambda.$$ \n\nSound is a mechanical, longitudinal wave: particles of the medium oscillate back-and-forth parallel to the direction the wave travels, creating compressions and rarefactions. The particles themselves do not travel with the wave; they vibrate around an equilibrium position.\n\nExample: If a sound wave has frequency 440 Hz and wavelength 0.78 m, the speed is $$v = f\\lambda = 440 \\times 0.78 \\approx 343\\text{ m/s}$$.",

      "content": "In a transverse wave, particles vibrate perpendicular to the wave’s direction (like a rope being shaken up and down). In a longitudinal wave (like sound), particles vibrate parallel to the direction of travel.\n\nRegardless of the type, the relationship $$v = f\\,\\lambda$$ still holds. If frequency increases while wave speed in that medium stays the same, the wavelength must decrease, and vice versa.\n\nExample: Light is transverse; sound is longitudinal.",

      "content": "The speed of sound depends on the medium’s properties. In general, sound travels fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases, because particles interact more strongly in solids.\n\nTypical values at room temperature:\n- Air: v ≈ 343 m/s\n- Water: v ≈ 1482 m/s\n- Steel: v ≈ 5000 m/s\n\nIn air, speed also increases with temperature. A useful approximation is: $$v_{\\text{air}} \\approx 331\\,\\text{m/s} + 0.6\\,T(^{\\circ}\\!\\text{C}).$$\n\nExample: At 20°C, $$v_{air} ≈ 331 + 0.6\\times20 = 343\\text{ m/s}$$.",

      "content": "A model for sound speed in fluids is $$v = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{B}{\\rho}},$$ where B is the bulk modulus (how hard it is to compress the fluid) and ρ is the density of the medium. A stiffer (larger B) or less dense (smaller ρ) medium gives a larger v.\n\nFor waves on a stretched string (useful in music), the speed is $$v = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{F_T}{\\mu}},$$ where F_T is the string tension and μ is the string’s linear mass density (kg/m). Increasing tension or using a lighter string increases wave speed.\n\nExample: For a string with μ = 0.01 kg/m and tension F_T = 100 N, $$v = \\sqrt{100/0.01} = \\sqrt{10000} = 100\\text{ m/s}$$.",

On a string, reflection at a fixed end inverts the pulse (crest returns as trough); at a free end it does not invert.\n- **Refraction**: a wave changes **speed** (and direction) when entering a new medium. **Frequency stays the same**, so the wavelength changes according to \\(v = f\\lambda\\).\n- **Diffraction**: waves **bend** around obstacles or spread through openings. Diffraction is most noticeable when the opening or obstacle size is comparable to \\(\\lambda\\).\n- **Absorption**: wave energy is converted to other forms (often thermal), reducing the wave’s amplitude.\n\nExample: Sound bending around a corner in a hallway is diffraction; echoing off a wall is reflection.",
