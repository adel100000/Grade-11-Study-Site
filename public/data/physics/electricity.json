      "content": "Electric current is the flow of electric charge over time. The current is defined as the rate of change of charge: $ I = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} $, where $ I $ is measured in amperes (A). Electric charge can be expressed as $ Q = ne $, where $ n $ is the number of electrons and $ e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} $ is the elementary charge. By convention, current direction is taken as the flow of positive charges from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. On the microscopic level, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor can be expressed as $ v_d = \\frac{I}{n A e} $, where $ A $ is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.",

The energy delivered by an electrical device over a period of time is given by $ E = P t = IVt $. These relationships allow us to calculate how circuits consume and transform energy in practical situations.",

Power in circuits can also be expressed using the form that matches what is constant: in series, current is the same in each element so $ P = I^2 R $ is convenient; in parallel, voltage across each branch is the same so $ P = \\dfrac{V^2}{R} $ is convenient.",
