In mechanics, we focus on **kinetic energy** (energy of motion) and **potential energy** (stored energy due to position or configuration). All forms of energy are measured in **Joules (J)**, where $$1\\,\\text{J} = 1\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2.$$\n\n**Kinetic Energy (K):**\n$$K = \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^2$$\n- $$m$$: mass in kilograms (kg)\n- $$v$$: speed in meters per second (m/s)\n\nExample: A 2.0 kg cart moving at 3.0 m/s has kinetic energy $$K = \\tfrac{1}{2}(2.0)(3.0)^2 = 9.0\\,\\text{J}.$$\n\n**Gravitational Potential Energy near Earth (U_g):**\n$$U_g = m g h$$\n- $$g$$: gravitational field strength $$\\approx 9.8\\,\\text{m/s}^2$$\n- $$h$$: height above a chosen reference level (m)\n\nChoosing the reference level sets where $$U_g = 0.$$ Only **changes** in potential energy matter physically.",
