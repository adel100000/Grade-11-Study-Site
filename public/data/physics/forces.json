      "content": "Dynamics is the branch of physics that studies the relationship between motion and the forces that cause it. A force can change the velocity of an object, meaning it can cause acceleration. The SI unit of force is the **Newton (N)**, where:\n\n$$1 \\; N = 1 \\; \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}^2$$\n\nThis means that one Newton is the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass by 1 m/s². When solving dynamics problems, it is important to always choose a reference frame and use clear **free body diagrams (FBDs)** to represent the forces acting on objects.",

Forces always come in pairs.\n\nExamples:\n- Pushing a wall: the wall pushes back on you with equal force.\n- Rocket propulsion: the rocket pushes exhaust gases backward, and the gases push the rocket forward.",
