1Ô∏è‚É£ Polish the content



Fix incorrect content: Start with units like Discrete Functions‚Äîmake sure your explanations are solid. Even small errors get noticed.



Better notation: Use superscripts, subscript, symbols instead of plain text (x^2 ‚Üí x¬≤). You can use HTML entities (\&sup2;) or MathJax/KaTeX if you want more complex math.



Break it down: Make content digestible‚Äîshort slides, examples, mini-quizzes. This shows teaching ability and initiative.



2Ô∏è‚É£ Add visuals



Graphs \& images: Replace placeholders with actual graphs/images. Could generate via Python (matplotlib) or use free graph generators.



Videos: If you can make short explainer clips or screen recordings of solutions, drop them into media.video.



Diagrams: Especially for physics‚Äîforces, kinematics, circuits. Makes your site interactive and legit.



3Ô∏è‚É£ Improve interactivity



Mini quizzes: Make them smart:



Randomized question order



Immediate feedback (‚ÄúCorrect!‚Äù / ‚ÄúOops, try again‚Äù)



Track progress



Highlight answers in lessons: like hover over formula ‚Üí explanation pops up.



4Ô∏è‚É£ Plan for future subjects



Once math \& physics are solid, you can add:



Chemistry (stoichiometry, reactions)



CS/Programming (logic, algorithms, small interactive code examples)



Make the site flexible‚Äîyour JSON + lesson viewer should handle any new subject without code rewrites.



5Ô∏è‚É£ UI/UX tweaks



Navigation: Smooth ‚Äúreturn to subject‚Äù / ‚Äúnext unit‚Äù flow.



Styling: Gradients, card shadows, responsive design.



Gamification: Badges, progress bars, completion rates‚Äîmakes it feel like a learning platform.



6Ô∏è‚É£ Hosting



Options once it‚Äôs polished:



Vercel: super easy for React/Vite. Free tier is enough.



Netlify: also easy, drag-and-drop or GitHub auto-deploy.



GitHub Pages: free, simple, good for portfolio projects.



You just build your project (npm run build) and deploy the /dist folder.



üí° Pro tip: Make it look ‚Äúuni ready‚Äù by:



Adding your name + a mini bio / about page



Showing skills \& tech stack



Maybe a contact section / GitHub link
