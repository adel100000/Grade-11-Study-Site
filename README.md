Grade 11 Study Hub – Math & Physics

Interactive Study Resource for Ontario Grade 11 Students

Overview

The Grade 11 Study Hub is an interactive online platform designed to help Ontario students master Grade 11 Math (MCR3U) and Physics (SPH3U). The website combines structured lesson content with quizzes and supplementary resources to create an engaging and self-paced study experience.

Currently, the site covers:

Math (MCR3U – Functions): Intro to Functions, Rational Expressions, Transformations, Exponential Functions, Trigonometry, Trig Functions, Discrete Functions

Physics (SPH3U): Kinematics, Forces, Energy & Thermal Physics, Sound Waves, Electricity

Future plans include expanding to additional subjects such as Chemistry (SCH3U).

Features

Lesson Cards: Each unit contains visually organized cards featuring an image, an explanatory video, and a link to supplementary resources for deeper study.

Interactive Quizzes: Quizzes accompany each lesson to reinforce learning and help students track their understanding.

Dynamic Content: Built with React and TypeScript, the site uses modern web development practices for responsive and interactive lessons.

Math Rendering: Uses KaTeX to render mathematical expressions for clarity in lessons.

Supplementary Links: Directs students to additional online content and practice opportunities.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, HTML

Libraries & Tools: KaTeX, React Router, Recharts, Radix UI components

The project was developed entirely independently, meant to showcase my problem-solving, coding, and debugging skills. Development required extensive planning, content organization, and consistent iteration over several weeks.

Deployment

The site is deployed on Netlify, making it publicly accessible to students and educators. Changes and updates can be easily pushed for continuous improvement.

Personal Highlights

Leadership & Organization: Independently gathered and structured all lesson content, ensuring each unit is comprehensive and coherent.

Coding & Problem-Solving: Implemented a fully interactive website from scratch using modern frontend technologies.

Determination & Dedication: Spent several weeks debugging, learning, and refining the platform to create a polished educational resource.
